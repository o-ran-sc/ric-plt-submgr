      "message": "I am fine if this part is not implemented. The E2 arch spec O-RAN.WG3.RICARCH shows this step (sending \"E2 Subscription Delete Query\" and waiting for a reply) as optional, but if we do it we also have to wait for the reply (with some timer) and handle it correctly.\n\nAs the spec leaves the possibility that a valid RIC implementation does not sent \"E2 Subscription Delete Query\" - and just deletes the subscriptions, I think, it would be good to have a config parameter for the sub mgr that defines whether to send these \"E2 Subscription Delete Query\" messages to xApps or whether to just delete the subscriptions for which the E2 node send a \"delete required\".\n\nBut as mentioned above, I think, an implementation is already good if it just deletes the subscriptions without further xApp involvement (other than the post-fact notification that the subscription has been successfully removed).",

We will update the code for removing the xApp involvement as mentioned in the shared feedback.\n\nFor sending notification to xApp ( once subscription gets deleted by subscription manager) an E2 API: E2 Subscription Delete Notification needs to be sent to xApp but this API is not yet defined in E2AP 3.0 document\n\nSo for now shall we just remove the piece of code related to xApps involvement ?",
