We will update the code for removing the xApp involvement as mentioned in the shared feedback.\n\nFor sending notification to xApp ( once subscription gets deleted by subscription manager) an E2 API: E2 Subscription Delete Notification needs to be sent to xApp but this API is not yet defined in E2AP 3.0 specification\n\nSo for now shall we just remove the piece of code related to xApps involvement ?",
